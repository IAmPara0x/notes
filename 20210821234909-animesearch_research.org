* Progress
1. Using Triplet loss against reviews of anime with genres ST
   $$g_{1} \cap g_{2} = \emptyset$$
   where,
   * $g1$ is a set of genres of an anime
   * $g2$ is a set of genres of a different anime

2. Reducing the size of the reviews to few sentences
3. Finetuning the transformers on reviews
4. using previosuly trained model as a feature extractor to extract important sentences from reviews and then train on those sentences
5. substituting all the anime names with special character =[ANIMENAME]= and with all the characters names with
   * =[MAINCHAR]=
   * =[MALECHAR]=
   * =[FEMALECHAR]=

     *why*? so, that it doesn't cluster by just seeing particular anime name or character name
6. using triplet loss with two different metrics distance and cosine similarity
   * *Doesn't know if it improves the performance*
7. using triplet loss against reviews of anime with tags ST
   $$t_{1} \cap t_{2} = \emptyset$$
   where,
   * $t1$ is a set of tags of an anime
   * $t2$ is a set of tags of a different anime
   *why*? Because tags tell more about the story of the anime and give more context about anime.

* Anime Context

** problems

- How to take more context of anime given a query aside from semantic similarity of a sentence of review?
  *This problem is kind of related to document clustering.*

** Models
*** Roberta-Base v3 Data v2
- Description: Roberta-Base from [[https://www.kaggle.com/iamparadox/review-ranking/edit/run/66037520]]
- Data Description: Changed all the anime names with special character [ANIMENAME]
  * [[https://www.kaggle.com/iamparadox/review-context-data/edit][Review Context Data]]
- Criterion: criterion is triplet-loss with p=2,m=2 and triplet loss with cosine-similarity as the metric with m=0.5
- Eval: after 1.5K steps
    * Eval Loss 1.11
    * Training Loss 1.07
- LR: 1e-5
