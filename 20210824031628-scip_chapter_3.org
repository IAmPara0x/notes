* Modularity, Objects, State

** Types of Programming procedures

*** Object Oreinted Programming
OOP views programs as individual computational objects that changes over the period of time. Local variables are used to describe the state of a particular computational object.
OOP introduces assignment that changes the value of the variables so normal susbtitution model can't be used to understand how a programs works. Therefore a new model of evaluation is introduced
*Environment Model Of Evalulation*.
