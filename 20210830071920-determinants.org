* Determinats
** what is the intuition behind determinats?
Think of determinats as norm of a vector but for matrix. what it does is maps some $$f: M_{n,n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$ just like
what norm does to a vector. Generally speaking norm measures the length of the vector just like that  $$det(A)$$
of a matrix measures volue of that matrix.

Therefore, determinats gives scaling factor and the oreintation induced of by mapping representend by a matrix.

Due to this $$det(I_{n,n})=1$$ because this measures the volume of matrix in $$R^{n}$$. If one of the row/column is zero/same then
the volume of $$R^{n}$$ dimension will also be zero.
